# e1039-analysis/EvalJpsiAsymStat

A program to evaluate the statistical precision of J/psi TSSA.
It has been made from `AnaSimDst` under `knakano0524/e1039-analysis`.
It was moved to `E1039-Collaboration/e1039-analysis` in Jan. 2022.

This version was used to produce the result presented on 2021-07-30.


## Event Generation

A normal set of J/psi simulated events has been already generated by Kenichi.
It is listed in `/pnfs/e906/persistent/users/kenichi/sim_data/jpsi_acc_20200914.list`.
The DST list (`AnaSimDst/work/list_dst.txt`) points to it be default.
Only when necessary, your own set can be generated with `SimChainDev`.


## Event Analysis by `AnaSimDst`

The simulated DSTs can be processed by `AnaSimDst`, as explained in `AnaSimDst/README.md`.
The conditions and qualities of simulated DSTs should be checked by looking into the outputs of `Fun4SimTree.C`.

This branch includes another ROOT macro, `asymmetry.C`.
It reads the tree (like `Fun4SimTree.C`) to compute J/psi TSSA;
```
root -b -q asymmetry.C
```


## Plot of Expected Accuracy

Another ROOT macro in this branch, `draw_stat_exp.cc`, can be used to draw the expected accuracy of J/psi TSSA.
You first write the simulated accuracy (which is obtained by `asymmetry.C`) into this macro manually and then execute it;
```
root -b -q draw_stat_exp.cc
```
